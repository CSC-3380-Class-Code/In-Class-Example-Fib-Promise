# Running commands

Make sure your current directory in terminal is Promises. You can check this with the following command:
```bash
# windows
cd

# Mac or Linux
pwd
```

After running the command, you should see a path similar to the following:
```
[Full path]/In-Class-Example-Fib-Promise/Promises
```

To look at the file, open Program.cs in the Promises folder

To run the file, use the following command to see the output:

```bash
dotnet run
```
